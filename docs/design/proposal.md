# SPA patient record management system

## Problem Description

On a daily basis, our client has to track customer experience and manage practice related information. Their current solution involves saving records on paper and public cloud softwares like OneDrive. This solution has limits when it comes to scalability, customizability, and reportability. The solution also has limited searchability and is time consuming to build reports. Therefore, the client is seeking a solution for an affordable and scalable practice management software that allows them to track customer experience and improve team productivity.

## Proposed Solution

We propose a cloud hosted, on-premise available customer management tool that allows the client to create and manage customer profiles, record details throughout customer visits, and generate comprehensive reports to improve customer experiences. The solution will support user identity, customizable forms, enhanced user inputs, full-text search, data reporting, and AI enabled analytics. Our solution will simplify customer visit tracking and improve user experience.

## Areas of focus:

- User identity for customers, employees and administrators
- Data collection with customizable forms
- External service integrations
- Full-text search
- Security &amp; privacy
- AI enabled natural language processing and analytics
