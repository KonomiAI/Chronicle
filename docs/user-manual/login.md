# Login & authentication

Chronicle has a robust access control system that protects you and your customers' data. This guide will detail how to use password sign in.

## I can login to the app but no data is loading and there is an error message saying I have no access

This means you are accessing the application from an IP address that is not permitted to do so. Contact your administrator to update the IP allowlist or change to a network/location where the access is permitted.

## How long do I stay signed in for?

Each sign in session lasts 7 hours, that means you must sign in every 7 hours when using the application. We are working on allowing you to maintain your authorized session with automatically renewed sessions.
