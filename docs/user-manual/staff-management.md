### Deleting a staff member

When you delete a staff member, their record is not remove entirely. Instead we erase any personal information recorded about the staff member. This includes their email, name, gender, and any associated custom forms.

## Super user & additional security

You will receive a _super user_ account when your account is first activated, the super user bypasses all firewall restrictions and has full access to the entire application. It is designed to allow the administrators of your establishment to configure the access control correctly before onboarding the remaining staff. We recommend that you suspend access to the account as soon as proper users have been configured.
