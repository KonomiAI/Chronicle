# Meeting 6

## Meeting date

Feb 9, 2022

## To discuss during the meeting

- Cloud architecture
- Overview of User Stories

## Notes

- Diccussed our user stories and went over anything that needs clarifying
  - Identity Access Control
  - Customer Profile
    - We want more flexibility with what our project fulfills
    - First deliverable should NOT support dynamic structures
    - What happens when a field is deleted? Does the deletion persist to existing entries?
      - Field deletion should NOT be cascaded to existing entries
      - Dicussed form templates: templates shared between our client and each individual customer can have custom fields
      - Our client can make a template and everything should be custom, the form should the same as a customer profile and an entry
  - Inventory
    - Two categories: physical goods and treaments
      - Seperate data models for each category atm, maybe think of integrating them into one
      - Dicussed the variants of physical goods
        - Product variants contain: price, Barcode, SKU
        - Goal of MVP: implement variants
        - Goal for long term: multi level variants
        - Shopify variant solution is a good reference point
  - Entries
    - Challenge: How are we going to work with custom fields and figure out searchability and readability (for data reporting)?
    - Entries will be more generic to activity or purchase entries
- Dicuss Cloud Infra
  - Host something simple on App Engine, get CI/CD deployment working
  - Kubernetes: not needed atm, maybe something to consider in the late future
- Dicuss Github Issues
  - Github issues doesn't allow for the creation of epics
  - Settled with 2 Kanban boards:
    - One for current sprint
    - One for general overview of past and present issues
  - Milestones will be used in place of "Epics" that encompass the user stories
  - Iteations will be used to keep progress of Sprintss
