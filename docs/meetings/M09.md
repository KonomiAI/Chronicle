## Meeting Notes

- Discuss Custom Forms:
    - Template schema, form itself and the responses of the form
    - All the forms the customers make has to conform to the json schema that we define
    - Json schema may be the first place to start for response validation, json schema is saved when user saves the form
- TODO: Discuss whether we should version the response along with the form?
    - Proposal: Response isn't linked to the form object iteself but the form version
    - We may need a seperate object to track customer forms.

    - **DILEMMA**: How to connect the forms to the features that they want?
    - Whenever you need to create a customer, you need to load these two forms because they are attached.

    - The admin creates the `TenantCustomerForms` relations
    - Q: Would a form be used both with creating customers and activity entries?
        - A: No, one form per data source
    - Forms could maybe have a "purpose" attached to them. Examples below:

    - **DILEMMA**: For a customer or a group, there COULD be different forms. 
    - For a form, specify the `PURPOSE`.
        - Example usage; Find form with the `PURPOSE` of `customer` and it will load all those forms
        - Forms can list `activity entry` as a PURPOSE, 
        - If form as has the `PURPOSE` of `inventory`, it can't show up for staff
    - Activity entries are **ALWAYS** associated with a customer, there should be no reason for a dangling activity entry.
    - [](images/M09_4.jpg)
    - Activity entry is associated with Customer in a 1 to 1 relationship
    - **Changes to Propose**
        1. Link reponse to form version
        2. Add description on relationship between response and entities.
