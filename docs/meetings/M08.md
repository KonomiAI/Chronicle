# Meeting 8

## Meeting date

Feb 23, 2022

## To discuss during the meeting

- Plan for the next sprint

## Notes
- Three things required the data reports:
    - Products bought
    - Activities done
    - Cash flow
    - New members/enrollments (may need to revisit, because we need to figure out whether we are doing a generic self service system -> architecture unclear)
- ORM
    - We're ended up moving forward with Prisma and already integrated with one of our branches
        - All the typing will be bounded as you define the schema
        - Schema provided through type checking is very nice
    - You can query for anything you want in the UI itself -> Prisma Studio (GUI) https://www.prisma.io/studio
    - Tasks required for IDP work: 
        - Spin up the database
        - Write the login page
        - Middleware for authentication and authorization layers
            - Firewall
        - Implement rows system
- Sprint Allocation
    - Get rid of milestone system
        - Store them all as markdown
    - Customer profiles is currently blocked by Forms
        - Forms is gonna be the most complicated milestone to tackle
    - Allocation of milestones for this sprint:
        - IDP: Yong, Andrew
        - Activity & Inventory: Daniel, Patrick
        - Floater: Anthony
