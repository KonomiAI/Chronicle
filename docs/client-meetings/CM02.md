# Client Meeting 02

## Meeting Date

Feb 3rd, 2022

### Raw Notes

- compile simple summary of mvp scope for client
- first staff login for the day tracking with date and time to keep record
- focus on user friendly ness and ease of use
- images in the activity entry
- one activity, one report

### Questions

- Do we have to manage anything related to taxes for items?
  - no for the products and activities are add without taxes
  - if we are deducting from customer balance then we need to include tax (push back?)
  - In activity entry client may want ability to give discounts (push back?)
  - for EOD reports with we should calculate taxes there too
- Are there customers that just come in and purchase a product? Does the purchase require a report?
  - yes this is possible
  - we may have to look at splitting product and activity entry because we still need to log just purchases of product
- What are the most important/common type of reports that you need?
  - EOD reports - specifics on what they want to see (follow up)
- Can you elaborate on what is a health record of your customers?
  - Can be really deep (for RMT) but not as deep for just facials
  - like do they have a pacemaker or condition
  - We may need to make this a bigger part which has more customizable field
  - for mvp we get critical basic info and leave room for general notes?
- Are picture upload for an activity entry something you need?
  - yes
- Can activity entry be updated/edited?
  - in theory and usually no, but they want that functionality and they want the track last edits

### Team Thoughts

Membership Balance tracking

- complex, definitely out of MVP scope
- we can do ledger for balance tracking, but to no invoices
  - Too much variables need to be accounted for with invoices
- Discounts
  - push back, not in MVP for sure (Perhaps not even at all)
  - too many variables to account for over time
    - with tracking how it changes data reporting

Medical records

- general notes in mvp
- custom fields in next iteration

General Thoughts

- They could look into Shopify for inventory and invoicing (maybe balance)
  - we can peak into that for them past mvp scope, but we might not want to take on that responsibility for them
- We should be focusing on our core product value propositions
  - activity / product purchase entries
  - data reporting and visualization
  - customer profiles
- We don't want to be an accounting software
  - the info on Chronicle should be a general overlook for the clients
- Data visualization is the second iteration focus, balance could be 3rd iteration focus

### Follow up

EOD reports - specifics on what they want to see in those reports (cash-flow, most performed activity, best selling product, etc)
