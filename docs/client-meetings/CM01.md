# Client Meeting 1

## Meeting Date

Jan 28th, 2022

## Topics of Discussion

### Employee Access

- Different Account Types

  - Admin - Can control and see all entries, accounts and additionally data reports
  - Provider - Read, write, edit, and search entries - this group maybe further subdivided into RMTs, estheticians, and consultants
  - Receptionist - Enter and edit customer information

- All employees of an account type have access to all the same information
- Restrict access to this system to only within the spa's network, exception for admin accounts

### Customer Visit Flow

1. A new customer has to fill in basic information on form, receptionist will input onto Chronicle
   - a member will have their profile pulled up if any changes are needed or balance is low
2. Do treatment/activity, purchase any products (0+), and that is recorded by the provider or providers
   - Will a customer do multiple different activities in one visit?
3. Does the customer want to become a member? add member information to customer profile

### Customer Profiles

- First time customers - name, email, phone number
- Members - included above, address, cc(?), health history/profile (allergies, body weight, etc), age/dob
  - Membership status, stats, and balance

### What do we need to keep reports/data on

- Activity report/entry -
  - includes:
    - customer
    - providers (automatically tracked by the edits? or both can add manually)
    - treatment/activity and repetition of this activity (automatic based on previous entries)
    - general notes (could be very specific in the case of RMTs but we can revisit this question)
    - critical notes (important information or follow up info for next visit)
    - products purchased with this activity
  - generally this will be one single generic entry, the specifics will be contained in the general or critical notes
  - this entry will also track spending, each activity and product has a price included
  - these entries must be searchable (by customer, activity, product etc.)
  - Version control required? write logs are needed on each entry
- Activities and Products (not inventory, but each activity and product with a price and details)
  - needs to be searchable too
- Migrating reports (possibly depending on timelines)
  - onedrive word documents
  - organized with customer name, email, phone number, and provider name

### Data Reporting

- EOD reports
  - covering the days activities, how many customers came in, which provider had the most customers, product sales, etc
  - Present visually
- Customer and members data reports
  - like EOD reports but for customers, should be visual as well
  - cover their most common product purchase, activity, provider etc
- Member account balance
- Employee login tracking, and write logs
  - version control?
  - write/edit logs on customer profiles and activity entries
  - log when employees login and include in EOD reports

### Post-Capstone support

- Client would like it if we could continue to support after capstone, but up to our discretion
- We can look into how we can make the process of managing the system simple for an external IT admin (if possible)
